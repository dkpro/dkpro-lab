DKPro Lab is a lightweight framework for parameter sweeping experiments. It allows to set up experiments consisting of multiple interdependent tasks in a declarative manner with minimal overhead. Parameters are injected into tasks using via annotated class fields. Data produced by a task for any particular parameter configuration is stored and re-used whenever possible to avoid the needless recalculation of results. Reports can be attached to each task to post-process the experimental results and present them in a convenient manner, e.g. as tables or charts.
